# Electronic-Component-Detection-using-YOLOv8
This project demonstrates real-time detection of electronic components—including resistors, capacitors, LEDs, diodes, transistors, and Zener diodes—using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model and OpenCV. Built and trained by Hassan Mroueh, it enables accurate, offline component recognition from a live camera feed.
